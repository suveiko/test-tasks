# 1. HTTP Request Handling Example

Write down code snippet using following requirements:

1. Use only vanilla TypeScript, without additional libraries. It also means that you
  should not use React or any other frameworks for this task.
2. For this assignment we will use REST Rick and Morty API.
3. Request ALL episodes from API.
4. `characters` array for each episode contains links to specific characters.
  Request them using API and then replace links in an array with these objects. So that `characters` field in each episode contains character objects instead of just URLs.
5. Log the final array of episodes into the console.
