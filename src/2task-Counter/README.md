# 2. Counter Example

Implement the `counter` function according to requirements:

1. Function accepts a number as the first argument. This number represents the
  initial value for the counter.
2. If no value passed to a function, use `0` as initial value.
3. Function returns array with two function:
   - First function returns the current counter value.
   - Second function increases the internal counter value by one and does
     not return anything.
4. Multiple calls of `counter` function create independent instances of counter
5. If you want to have bonus points then write unit tests using your favorite
  framework.
